Spent most of the time dealing with importing the data into SQL. Originally, I was going to just read straight from the
CSV files themselves, but I realize putting the data into a DB would both ben more efficient for reading and querying,
but also allow me to work on more varied skills, mainly database management and admin duties. Importing the data proved
more timely than desired, but I was able to get the gamelog info from 1920 successfully imported, as anything before
had quite unfinished data. Next, I'll try to get python set up to read and retrieve data from the DB.
